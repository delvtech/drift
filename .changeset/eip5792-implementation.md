EIP-5792 Wallet Call API Implementation

## üöÄ Features

**EIP-5792 Wallet Call API Support**
- Added complete [EIP-5792](https://www.eip5792.xyz) (Wallet Call API) implementation to all adapters with `getWalletCapabilities()`, `getCallsStatus()`, `showCallsStatus()`, and `sendCalls()` methods + comprehensive type definitions.
- Supports calls in a variety of formats including ABI function calls, ABI deploy calls, raw calldata, and raw bytecode (deployless) calls.
- Added methods for EIP-5792 functionality to `MockAdapter`:
  - `onGetWalletCapabilities()`
  - `onGetCallsStatus()`
  - `onShowCallsStatus()`
  - `onSendCalls()`
- Added `getWalletCallsStatusLabel()` util function for generating user-friendly labels for wallet call statuses.

**New Web Example Application**
- Added a React + TypeScript + Vite example application.
- Includes integration examples for all adapter types (default, ethers, viem, web3).
- Demonstrates EIP-5792 wallet call functionality.

## üîß Improvements

**Enhanced Testing Utilities**
- Added `randomSelection` utility for selecting random items from arrays.
- Added `createStubWalletCallsStatus` for testing EIP-5792 functionality.
- Improved `MockAdapter` with better type definitions and expanded functionality.
- Added method parameter types to exports:
  - `OnReadParams`
  - `OnSimulateWriteParams`
  - `OnMulticallParams`
  - `OnDeployParams`
  - `OnWriteParams`
  - `OnSendCallsParams`
  - `StubMulticallCallParams`
  - `StubWalletCallParams`.

**Call Preparation and Processing**
- Added `prepareCall` utility function for unified call preparation across different call types (function calls, deploy calls, encoded calls, bytecode calls).
- Enhanced multicall functionality to support mixed call types including encoded calls alongside ABI function calls.
- Improved call processing in all adapters by centralizing call preparation logic.

**Type System Enhancements**
- Added `BytecodeCallParams` type for bytecode-based calls without contract addresses.
- Improved type inference for multicall operations with mixed call types.
- Added `PartialByOptional` utility type for better optional property handling.

**Adapter Improvements**
- Better fallback handling for individual wallet call stub matching in `MockAdapter`.
- Refactored Web3 adapter to use injected provider for `getSignerAddress` and EIP-5792 calls.
- Improved internal adapter utilities and type safety.
- Added `NotImplementedError` as a generalized replacement for stub-specific errors.

**Client and Caching Enhancements**
- Enhanced multicall caching to support both function calls and encoded calls.
- Improved cache key generation for mixed call types.

**Utility Functions**
- Added `toHexString` utility for flexible hex string conversion
- Enhanced `isHexString` with configurable `prefix` option to control `0x` prefix enforcement.
- Improved `DriftError` to automatically use constructor name for subclasses.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

**Package Configuration**
- Fixed `@delvtech/drift-web3` package.json fields to point to correct dist files.
- Updated gitignore files across all packages.

**Type Safety**
- Enhanced `FunctionCallParams` to infer function names even when `address` is missing.
- Improved adapter type definitions and method signatures.
- Better error handling and type checking throughout the codebase.
- Enhanced multicall type inference to support mixed call types (function calls, encoded calls, etc.).
- Improved readonly array handling for better immutability support.

## üì¶ Dependencies

- Upgraded all dependencies to their latest versions.
- Updated Node.js version requirement (`.nvmrc`) to `v24`

## üîÑ Internal Changes

- Restructured examples directory with dedicated Node.js and web folders.
- Updated biome configuration (renamed from `.jsonc` to `.json`).
- Improved internal type utilities for better developer experience.

**Breaking Changes:** None

**Migration Guide:** This release is fully backward compatible. The new EIP-5792 functionality is opt-in and doesn't affect existing adapter usage patterns.
