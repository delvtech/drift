# Patterns for Multi-Chain Deployments

Drift is well-suited for applications that interact with contracts on multiple blockchain networks. Here are some patterns for managing multi-chain deployments.

## One Client per Chain

The most straightforward approach is to create a separate Drift client for each chain you support.

```typescript
import { createDrift } from "@delvtech/drift";

const mainnetDrift = createDrift({ rpcUrl: "[MAINNET_RPC_URL]" });
const polygonDrift = createDrift({ rpcUrl: "[POLYGON_RPC_URL]" });

const mainnetToken = mainnetDrift.contract({ ... });
const polygonToken = polygonDrift.contract({ ... });
```

## Chain-Aware SDKs

If you are building a reusable SDK layer, you can make it chain-aware by accepting a chain ID or a Drift client instance in the constructor.

```typescript
class MySdk {
  private drift: Drift;

  constructor(chainId: number) {
    this.drift = createDrift({ rpcUrl: getRpcUrlForChain(chainId) });
  }

  // ... sdk methods
}

const mainnetSdk = new MySdk(1);
const polygonSdk = new MySdk(137);
```

This pattern allows you to easily switch between chains while keeping your application logic clean and organized.
