# Building Reusable Protocol SDKs

One of the powerful patterns that Drift enables is the creation of reusable,
library-agnostic SDKs for your smart contracts. This allows you to
encapsulate your contract logic into a clean, reusable client that can be
used across different applications and environments, without being tied to a
specific web3 library or state management solution.

## Example: A Vault Client

Let's walk through building a simple SDK for an
[ERC-4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/)
vault, with both read-only and read-write clients.

### 1. Create a Read-Only Client

First, we define a `ReadVault` class that wrap Drift's `ReadContract`
abstraction.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [ReadVault.ts] filename="ReadVault.ts"
// @filename: ReadVault.ts
// ---cut---
import {
  type Address,
  createDrift,
  type Drift,
  type ReadContract,
} from "@delvtech/drift";
import { type VaultAbi, vaultAbi } from "./abi";

/**
 * A read-only Vault client
 */
export class ReadVault {
  contract: ReadContract<VaultAbi>;

  constructor(address: Address, drift: Drift = createDrift()) {
    this.contract = drift.contract({
      abi: vaultAbi,
      address,
    });
  }

  getBalance(account: Address) {
    return this.contract.read("balanceOf", { account });
  }

  async getAssetValue(account: Address) {
    const shares = await this.getBalance(account);
    return this.contract.read("convertToAssets", { shares });
  }

  // ... other read methods as needed
}
```

```ts twoslash [abi.ts] filename="abi.ts"
// @filename: abi.ts
// ---cut---
import { erc4626 } from "@delvtech/drift";

export type VaultAbi = typeof erc4626.abi;
export const vaultAbi = erc4626.abi;
```

:::

### 2. Extend to Create a Read-Write Client

Next, we create a `ReadWriteVault` class that extends `ReadVault` to add write
operations using Drift's `ReadWriteContract` abstraction.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [ReadWriteVault.ts] filename="ReadWriteVault.ts"
// @filename: ReadWriteVault.ts
// ---cut---
import {
  type Address,
  createDrift,
  type Drift,
  type ReadWriteAdapter,
  type ReadWriteContract,
} from "@delvtech/drift";
import type { VaultAbi } from "./abi";
import { ReadVault } from "./ReadVault";

/**
 * A read-write Vault client that can sign transactions
 */
export class ReadWriteVault extends ReadVault {
  declare contract: ReadWriteContract<VaultAbi>; // [!code hl]

  constructor(
    address: Address,
    drift: Drift<ReadWriteAdapter> = createDrift(), // [!code hl]
  ) {
    super(address, drift);
  }

  deposit(amount: bigint, account: Address) {
    return this.contract.write(
      "deposit",
      { assets: amount, receiver: account },
      {
        onMined: (receipt) => {
          if (receipt?.status === "success") {
            // Clear cached state for this contract
            this.contract.cache.clearReads();
          }
        },
      },
    );
  }

  // ... other write methods as needed
}
```

```ts twoslash [ReadVault.ts]
// @filename: ReadVault.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ReadVault.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [abi.ts]
// @filename: abi.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include abi.ts]
```

:::

### 3. Use the Client in Your Application

You can now use this `VaultClient` in your application with any web3 library
supported by Drift.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: vault-sdk.d.ts
declare module "vault-sdk" {
  import type { Address, Drift, ReadContract, erc4626 } from "@delvtech/drift";
  /** A read-only Vault client */
  export class ReadVault {
    contract: ReadContract<typeof erc4626.abi>;
    constructor(address: Address, drift?: Drift);
    getBalance(account: Address): Promise<bigint>;
    getAssetValue(account: Address): Promise<bigint>;
  }
}
// @filename: app.ts
// ---cut---
import { ReadVault } from "vault-sdk";
import { drift } from "./clients";

const vault = new ReadVault("0x...", drift);
const assetValue = await vault.getAssetValue("0x...");
```

```ts twoslash [clients.ts] filename="clients.ts"
// @filename: clients.ts
// ---cut---
import { createDrift } from "@delvtech/drift";
import { viemAdapter } from "@delvtech/drift-viem";
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains";

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
});

export const drift = createDrift({
  adapter: viemAdapter({ publicClient }),
});
```

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Reusability:** Write your business logic once and reuse it across
  different applications and environments.
- **Simplicity:** Your application code becomes cleaner and more focused on
  business logic.
- **Testability:** This pattern is easy to test using Drift's mocking
  utilities.
