# Core Concepts

This section explains the fundamental concepts and architecture of Drift.

## What Makes Drift Different?

Drift is not just another web3 library. It's a meta-library that provides a consistent, high-level API on top of existing libraries like ethers, viem, and web3.js. This approach offers several advantages over using these libraries directly:

- **Abstraction:** You can switch between underlying web3 libraries without changing your application code.
- **Simplicity:** Drift simplifies common tasks like state management, caching, and multicall.
- **Type Safety:** Drift leverages TypeScript to provide strong type safety for your contract interactions.

## Architecture Overview

Drift's architecture is designed to be modular and extensible. The core components are:

- **Client:** The main entry point for interacting with Drift, created with `createDrift`.
- **Adapter:** A wrapper around a web3 provider (e.g., from ethers or viem) that normalizes its behavior.
- **Store:** A cache for storing and retrieving contract data.
- **Contract:** A type-safe representation of a smart contract, created with `drift.contract()`.
- **Hooks:** Middleware for intercepting and modifying actions.

Here is a high-level diagram of the architecture:

Contract -> Client -> Hooks -> Store -> Adapter
```

### The Drift Client

The Drift Client is the central piece of the library. It orchestrates the interactions between the other components.

### Contracts & Type Safety

Drift generates type-safe contract instances from your ABIs. This means you get autocompletion and type checking for your contract functions, arguments, and return values.

### Adapters & Provider Abstraction

Adapters are the bridge between Drift and the underlying web3 libraries. They allow you to use Drift with your favorite library without worrying about the implementation details.

### Smart Caching with Stores

Drift includes a built-in caching mechanism to reduce RPC calls and improve performance. You can also implement custom cache stores to fit your needs.

### Hooks & Middleware

Hooks allow you to extend Drift's functionality by adding middleware to the client. You can use hooks to implement custom logic before or after actions are executed.

## When to Use Drift vs. Direct Web3 Libraries

Drift is a great choice for building complex dApps that need to interact with multiple contracts, manage state, and optimize performance. However, if you are building a simple script or a small dApp, using a web3 library directly might be sufficient.
