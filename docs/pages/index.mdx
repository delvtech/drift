# What is Drift?

Drift is a powerful and flexible library that simplifies Ethereum development by providing a unified, type-safe interface for interacting with smart contracts across various web3 libraries like viem, web3.js, and ethers. It's designed to let you write your protocol logic once and run it anywhere, saving you from vendor lock-in and the need to rewrite code when switching providers.

## Key Problems Drift Solves

- **Reduce RPC Calls:** Built-in caching to optimize performance by reducing redundant RPC calls.
- **Avoid Provider Lock-In:** Write your protocol logic once and run it anywhere.
- **Simplify UI State Management:** A unified interface for interacting with smart contracts.
- **Test with Confidence:** Easy-to-use, type-safe testing mocks.
- **Extensibility:** Add new web3 libraries with a flexible adapter system.
