# Drift Documentation

## What is Drift?

Drift is a meta-library that simplifies Ethereum development by providing a
unified, type-safe interface for blockchain interactions across web3 libraries
like [viem](https://viem.sh) and [ethers](https://ethers.org) with built-in
caching to automatically optimize performance, type-safe testing mocks for
effortless testing, and a flexible hook system for middleware.

This makes it possible to **write your protocol logic once and run it
anywhere**. For example, you can create a library agnostic protocol SDK that can
be used with multiple providers without maintaining separate
implementations or rewrites.

## Key Problems Drift Solves

### ‚ö° Reduce RPC Calls

Built-in caching automatically optimizes performance by reducing redundant RPC
calls. No need to manage frontend hooks or query keys for each call.

### üåê Multi-Library Support

Write your protocol logic once with Drift's unified interface and run it across
different web3 libraries without rewriting code or maintaining multiple
implementations.

### üéØ Simplify UI State Management

Drift's consistent API and built-in caching reduce the complexity of managing
blockchain data in your UI. Use it directly or wrap calls in your preferred
state management library.

### üß™ Test with Confidence

Easy-to-use, type-safe [testing
mocks](http://localhost:5173/guides/testing-strategies) that are always in sync
with your contracts. Test your business logic without network calls.

### üîå Extensibility

Support new web3 libraries and handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, error
handling, and rate limiting with flexible
[adapter](/guides/extending-drift#implementing-custom-adapters)
and
[hook](/guides/extending-drift#using-hooks-for-middleware)
systems.

## Quick Start

:::code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install @delvtech/drift
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add @delvtech/drift
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @delvtech/drift
```

```sh [bun]
bun add @delvtech/drift
```

:::

```ts twoslash
import { createDrift, erc20 } from "@delvtech/drift";

const drift = createDrift({
  rpcUrl: "YOUR_RPC_URL",
});

// Read with automatic caching
const balance = await drift.read({
  abi: erc20.abi,
  address: "0x...",
  fn: "balanceOf",
  args: { account: "0x..." },
});
```
