# Drift Documentation

Drift is a powerful meta-library that simplifies Ethereum development by
providing a unified, type-safe interface for blockchain interactions across web3
libraries like [viem](https://viem.sh) and [ethers](https://ethers.org).

## What is Drift?

Drift lets you **write your protocol logic once and run it anywhere**. Your code
will be usable with multiple providers without rewrites. Built-in caching
automatically optimizes performance, while type-safe testing mocks make testing
effortless.

## Key Problems Drift Solves

### âš¡ Reduce RPC Calls

Built-in caching automatically optimizes performance by reducing redundant RPC
calls. No need to manage hooks or query keys for each call.

### ðŸ”„ Avoid Provider Lock-In

Write your protocol logic once with Drift's unified interface and run it across
different web3 libraries without rewriting code.

### ðŸŽ¯ Simplify UI State Management

Drift's consistent API and built-in caching reduce the complexity of managing
blockchain data in your UI. Use it directly or wrap calls in your preferred
state management library.

### ðŸ§ª Test with Confidence

Easy-to-use, type-safe testing mocks that are always in sync with your
contracts. Test your business logic without network calls.

### ðŸ”Œ Extensibility

Add new web3 libraries with a flexible adapter system. Designed to grow with
your project's needs.

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install @delvtech/drift
```

```ts
import { createDrift, erc20 } from "@delvtech/drift";

const drift = createDrift({
  rpcUrl: "YOUR_RPC_URL",
});

// Read with automatic caching
const balance = await drift.read({
  abi: erc20.abi,
  address: "0x...",
  fn: "balanceOf",
  args: { account: "0x..." },
});
```
